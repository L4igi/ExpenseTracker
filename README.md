# Expense Tracker (Java Spring Boot, Rest) 
This Expense Tracker applicatiom was created as a Group Effort as part of the Software Engineering Course at the University of Vienna. A team of three implemented 
the application during one semester. 
## What it is? 
The main focus of this project is to create a working application incoorperating design patterns, using Unit tests and version control throughout the implementation process
and providing a useful and complete documentation of the code. 

The program itself manages different bank accounts and processes transactions. The web based application is built using Rest with a H2 database in the back. 

## My contribution to the Project
I implemented about 70% of the backend, including creation of most of the patterns and managing the Database. Furtheremore all JUNIT tests were created an validated by me. 
One of my collegues helped setting up the project and designing the applications backend logic and documentation. The other collegue was tasked with creating the frontend 
of the application. 
Further information about the Project can be found in the Report_DEAD.pdf file in this repository
